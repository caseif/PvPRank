# PvPRank

Bukkit plugin for ranking players based on PvP stats.

This was *literally* the first project I ever wrote in Java. The code is probably pretty terrible, and I don't remember
exactly how the plugin works or how to use it. To emphasize, this software is offered *as-is* with no guarantee of
compatibility or functionality.

This software is released as public domain. You may do what you wish with it (except plagiarize it, because that isn't
cool).
